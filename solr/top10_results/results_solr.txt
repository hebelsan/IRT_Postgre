        "section_text":"Several games have been derived from nine-ball. Six-ball is essentially identical to nine-ball but with three fewer balls, which are racked in a three-row triangle, with the money ball, placed in the center of the back row. According to Rudolph Wanderone Jr., the game arose in early 20th century billiard halls; halls charged for matches by the 15 ball rack rather than by table, so players of nine-ball had six balls leftover. For this reason, the game is often played with the balls numbered between 10 and 15, with the 15-ball as the money ball.Seven-ball is also similar, though it differs in two key ways: the game uses only seven object balls, which are racked in a hexagon, and players are restricted to pockets on their designated side the table. William D. Clayton is credited with the game's invention in the early 1980s. While not a common game, it was featured on television broadcaster ESPN's Sudden Death Seven-ball which aired in the early 2000s.\n\nThe most common derivative game is the game of Ten-ball. The game is a more stringent variant, utilizing ten balls in which all pocketed balls must be called. Unlike in nine-ball, the money ball cannot be pocketed on the break for an instant win. Due to its more challenging nature, and the fact that there is no publicly known technique for reliably pocketing specific object balls on the break shot, there have been suggestions among the professional circuit that ten-ball should replace nine-ball as the pro game of choice, especially since the rise of the nine-ball soft break, which is still legal in most international and non-European competition. Ten-ball has its own world championship known as the WPA World Ten-ball Championship.",

In games where the balls are rolled, the delivery is typically done with the palm of the hand up, whereas in games where the balls are thrown, the delivery is typically done palm down.  A palm-down delivery can give a thrown ball backspin, which helps to keep it from rolling away from the spot to which it has been thrown.\nBocce, a rolling game, is played on a smooth, prepared court with markers and sideboards; the sideboards are a recognized part of the game and shots may be bounced off of the sideboards.  In contrast, pétanque, a throwing game, can be played on almost any relatively flat, unprepared outdoor surface.  Sideboards are not a recognized part of the game — although an out-of-play line (or \"dead boule line\") is.Finally, some boules games (bocce, pétanque) began as variations of earlier games, deliberately created and designed to accommodate the needs of players with physical disabilities.\nSuch variations produce a wide variety of boules-type games played all over the world.",

Highly teamwork oriented, the game was played between two teams of usually 12 to 14 players each, with one ball and the rules of the game which allowed using hands. \nAlthough it was a ball game, it was violent, at least in Sparta. The teams would try to throw the ball over the heads of the other team. There was a white line called the skuros between the teams and another white line behind each team. Teams would change the ball often until one of the team was forced behind the line at their end. In Sparta a form of episkyros was played during an annual city festival that included five teams of 14 players. It was played primarily by men but women also practiced it. The Greek game of episkyros (or a similar game called φαινίνδα, phaininda, probably meaning \"deceiving game\", from the verb φενακίζω, phenakizo, \"(I) cheat, lie\") was later adopted by the Romans, who renamed and transformed it into harpastum, the latinisation of the Greek ἁρπαστόν (harpaston), neuter of ἁρπαστός (harpastos), \"carried away\", from the verb ἁρπάζω (harpazo), \"(I) seize, snatch\".A depiction in low relief on the belly of the vase displayed at the National Archaeological Museum, Athens. shows a Greek athlete balancing a ball on his thigh. This image is reproduced on the European Cup football trophy. Other ancient Greek sports with a ball besides phaininda, were: ἀπόῤῥαξις (aporrhaxis, 'bouncing ball game'), οὐρανία (ourania, 'throwing a ball high in air game') and maybe the σφαιρομαχία (sphairomachia), literally \"ball-battle\", from σφαῖρα (sphaira) \"ball, sphere\" and μάχη (mache), \"battle\"., although it has been argued that the σφαιρομαχία is in fact a boxing competition (the \"spheres\" being in fact a kind of gloves).Julius Pollux includes phaininda and harpastum in a list of ball games:\n\nPhaininda takes its name from Phaenides, who first invented it, or from phenakizein (to deceive), because they show the ball to one man and then throw to another, contrary to expectation.

There are several variations such as if the game is played in a gym.  If a player hits the basketball hoop's backboard then that team frees all eliminated players.  The game is also sometimes played with three pins per team and variations of this game are also known as Pin Guard or Battle Ball.  Another variation changes the purpose of the pins, in this variation it restores all the members of the opposing team. (Objective type is Revival)",

        "section_text":"Zone Ball is a novelty game played sometimes at Darkzone stores. The game involves bases, but instead of trying to destroy the bases, players use the bases as a sort of soccer goal. The game is team-based, and the aim of the game is for each team to score the highest number of goals in the game. In the beginning, players must stand in their team's base, and then the bases lights will turn on. The first player to shoot any base anywhere, is given the ball, and an audible signal will be heard every few seconds to confirm that the player has the ball. There is only one ball at any one time in the game. The goal is then to make it into an enemy base and shoot their base to score a point. Players can pass the ball to teammates by shooting them, and players may steal the ball from enemy players by shooting the player with the ball. Players can shoot enemies who do not have the ball, in order to deactivate them for a period of time, so that they cannot steal the ball or cause any trouble. Once a player has scored a goal by shooting an enemy base while in possession of the ball, there is a short delay before the ball is up for grabs again, at which point players can grab the ball by being the first to shoot any base.",

        "section_text":"The game starts off with a coin toss. When a team is kicking off they must be on their side of the midline, the opposing team must be on the opposite side of the midline and outside the circle. Whichever team wins the toss will start with the ball in the middle of the field. Speedaway uses a soccer ball which may be moved down the field on the ground as in soccer, or by passing through the air similar to football. When an offensive player has possession of the ball and an opponent tags or simply touches him or her, the player must instantly drop the ball and give possession to the defending team. The team that gains possession must now kick the ball from where it was dropped. To pass the ball to a teammate, one may kick, throw, or bounce pass accordingly. When bounce passing to another teammate the ball can only hit the ground once. If the ball bounces more than one time the team with possession cannot pick the ball back up. When the ball is kicked or thrown out of bounds, the team that last touched the ball loses possession and the opposite team may throw or kick the ball into the field. Only the goalie can pick up the ball with his or her hands at any give time.  All players, beside the goalie, have to kick the ball up to themselves from the ground in order to run with the ball or make aerial passes. Each team has three time-outs they may use during the game. Any player with possession of the ball may call time-out when the ball is dead or when someone is injured. The game is broken down into four quarters and two halves each quarter being ten minutes long, making the game forty minutes. Speedaway ball is officiated by two referees, each official is responsible for each half of the field. Their responsibilities include: stopping the game after each quarter, calling fouls, and out of bounds plays. Officials must place the ball before kick offs and have the authority to remove players from play who are being too aggressive, in their own judgement.",

        "section_text":"Bat-and-ball games (or safe haven games) are field games played by two opposing teams, in which the action starts when the defending team throws a ball at a dedicated player of the attacking team, who tries to hit it with a bat. The best known modern bat-and-ball games are baseball and cricket, with common roots in the 18th-century games played in England. \nThe teams alternate between \"batting\" (offensive) role, sometimes called \"in at bat\" or simply in, and \"fielding\" (defensive role), also called \"out in the field\" or out. Only the batting team may score, but teams have equal opportunities in both roles. The game is counted rather than timed. The action starts when a player on the fielding team puts the ball in play with a delivery whose restriction depends on the game. A player on the batting team attempts to strike the delivered ball, commonly with a \"bat\", which is a club governed by the rules of the game.  After striking the ball, the batter may become a runner trying to reach a safe haven or \"base\". While in contact with a base, the runner is safe from the fielding team and in a position to score runs. Leaving a safe haven places the runner in danger of being put out. The teams switch roles when the fielding team puts the batting team out, which varies by game.\nIn modern baseball, the fielders put three players out. In cricket, they retire all players but one.  In many forms of early American baseball (townball, roundball), a single out ended the inning. Some games permit multiple runners and some have multiple bases to run in sequence. Batting may occur, and running begin, at one of the bases. The movement between those \"safe havens\" is governed by the rules of the particular sport.",
